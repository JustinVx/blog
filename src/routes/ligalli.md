description: Helping female patients take their medication in a safer and easier way
intro: For the medical start-up LiGalli, I worked on designing an MVP for the MedRing companion app. An app that helps female patients take their medication in a safer and easier way.

[LiGalli](https://www.ligalli.health) is a medical start-up focused on enhancing the quality of life and care of women through intelligent drug delivery and diagnostics. They are in the process of developing the MedRing. The MedRing is a vaginal ring that can deliver medication on regular schedule and in the future can also be used to monitor diagnostics. LiGalli has their market launch planned for 2024.

A companion app is being developed in order to control the medication that is being deliverd by the MedRing. For this companion app I worked in a small team of designers, where we deliverd a design for an MVP within five weeks. We focused on creating a intuitive and innovative app that empowers women take control over their health. Our goal was to help women manage their treatment in a clear, reliable and hassle-free way and to give understandable and condensed insights in their progress.

We split the core funtionality of the app in an onboarding part, a scheduling part and an insights parts. In the five weeks we created the UX design and UI design, did a usability test with six participants which we used to improve the design and also designed a concept for the back-office. I was mostly responsible for the scheduling part and the back-office.
