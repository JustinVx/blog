description: Helping small businesses ship goods easily without logistics experience
intro: At this succesfull subsidiary of Maersk, I'm working on improving the experience for small companies that want to ship goods from A to B, but don't have the experience or the connections that other companies have.

At Twill I have submerged myself into the complicated world of logistics. Twill focuses on small businesses with little logistics experience. As the UX Designer for the self-management team I'm working on everything that comes after a booking has been made. How to help the user deal with things like VGM, HS codes and Outwards Customs Brokers, when this is all new to them? And how can we do as much as possible for our users without them even realising it?

I'm currently working on this project. Ask me for more information.
