description: Helping small businesses ship goods easily without logistics experience
intro: At this succesfull subsidiary of Maersk, I'm working on improving the experience for small companies that want to ship goods from A to B, but don't have the experience or the connections that other companies have.

At Twill I have submerged myself into the complicated world of logistics. Twill focuses on small businesses with little logistics experience. As the UX Designer for the self-management team I'm working on everything that comes after a booking has been made. 

In order to ship goods from A to B, users will have to deal with things like VGM, HS codes and Outwards Customs Brokers. For most first-time users these terms sound like words from a foreign language. How can we help these users deal with these subjects? And how can we take out as much work as possible for them?

I'm currently working on this project. [Ask me](mailto:twill@justinvenbrux.nl) for more information.
