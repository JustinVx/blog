description: Increasing user satisfaction and conversion for several private lease websites 
intro: I helped improve the private lease websites for Renault, Nissan and Dacia in order to increase conversion and user satisfaction.
---

RCI Banque is a financial services company in the automotive industry and part of the Groupe Renault. RCI is responsible for the private lease websites of Renault, Nissan and Dacia. They noticed that conversion of their website was pretty low and asked Soda Studio to improve this. In a small team I worked on doing this by using a user-centered approach and focusing mostly on improving user satisfaction. We used the current website as a base and used their existing design system. The design was focused on the Renault website at first and after validation it was transferred to the websites of Nissan and Dacia.

Our goal was to make the website simple, clear and honest. During stakeholder interviews and user testing we found that the proposition was not clear enough, that users did not feel supported in making the right decision and that the disadvantages are not clearly communicated. In just three weeks we created a redesign which resulted in an improved conversion from 0.4% to 1%.
